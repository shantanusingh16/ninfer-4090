# NInfer-4090

NInfer-4090 runs **Qwen3.8-27B** on one 24 GB NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090. It is an `sm_89` port of
[NInfer-3090](https://github.com/Don-Chad/ninfer-3090), which derives from
[Neroued/ninfer](https://github.com/Neroued/ninfer), a specialized C++20/CUDA inference engine.
The engine loads the official groupwise `.ninfer` artifact, serves OpenAI- and
Anthropic-compatible APIs, and supports paged KV, compatible-prefix reuse, CUDA Graphs, MTP
speculative decoding, reasoning-effort control, and ReplaySSM state transactions.

This fork targets `sm_89` and Linux. Blackwell-only NVFP4/W4A4 execution is unavailable; the
engine uses the same groupwise-int path as the 3090 base. The Windows path and the
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B target are inherited but untested on the RTX 4090.

## Measured results on the RTX 4090

Conditions: single request, greedy decoding, CUDA Graphs on, INT8 KV, `--prefill-chunk 1024`,
official 16.96 GiB Qwen3.8-27B artifact. The code-generation decode row and the prefill rows
are measured from the `ninfer-serve` `/metrics` counters (computed prefill only); the other
decode rows use the `ninfer` CLI.

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
| Decode, code generation, MTP3 | **148.6 tok/s** at 81.0% draft acceptance |
| Decode, bench corpus, MTP3 | 106.5 tok/s at 48.7% acceptance |
| Decode, no speculation | 50.5 tok/s |
| Decode at 128K depth, no speculation | 39.6 tok/s |
| 64K needle-in-a-haystack | exact answer, 1,849 tok/s prefill |
| 128K needle-in-a-haystack | exact answer, 1,561 tok/s prefill |
| Vision, chart reading | 3 of 3 oracle facts, 22 ms vision tower |
| Ops test suite | 78 of 78 runnable tests pass on `sm_89` |

MTP acceptance, and with it the decoded rate, tracks how predictable the output is: structured
code accepts about 81% of draft tokens, the mixed bench corpus about 49%.

The shipping default has since moved from INT8 KV to the E8 4-bit KV mode, which serves the
model's full native 262,144-token context on this card. Retrieval stays exact through 260K
(single-needle, 5-needle, and exact-code-detail probes), MTP acceptance at depth is unchanged,
and the costs against the INT8 numbers above are a 5.7% decode tax and 1-2% of prefill; see
[Quick start](#text-only-full-262k-native-context-e8-4-bit-kv-default) for the measured deltas.

For scale: llama.cpp on the same card decodes the Qwen3.8-27B `UD-Q4_K_XL` GGUF at about
46 tok/s in a 144K-context configuration where the MTP buffers do not fit. The upstream engine
on an RTX 5090 measures 172 tok/s on the same code-generation prompts with a 400 W power cap
(the upstream README quotes about 200), so this card lands within 14% of it under MTP.

### Depth sweep against llama.cpp

Both engines were measured on the same card. llama.cpp build 10358 ran `llama bench` on the
`UD-Q4_K_XL` GGUF (16.68 GiB) with q8_0 KV cache, flash attention, and `-ub 1024 -b 4096`,
which matches its deployed configuration, on 2026-08-15. The NInfer side was re-measured on
2026-08-17 on the deployed E8 262K configuration through the `/metrics` counters; the
llama.cpp configuration did not change between the dates. Two caveats: the artifacts differ
by about 2% in size, and `llama bench` is a bare kernel loop while the NInfer numbers
include the full server path.

Marginal rates at depth:

| Depth | llama.cpp pp2048 | llama.cpp tg32 | NInfer decode, no speculation |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 3,024 tok/s | 45.9 tok/s | 50.4 tok/s |
| 32K | 2,327 | 42.0 | - |
| 64K | 1,866 | 38.6 | - |
| 128K | 1,336 | 33.1 | 42.1 |
| 256K | no entry | no entry | 36.6 |

Wall time to prefill one full prompt (llama.cpp integrated from the marginal rates, NInfer
measured):

| Prompt | llama.cpp | NInfer |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 32K | 12.5 s (2,630 tok/s) | 14.5 s (2,027 tok/s) |
| 64K | 28.3 s (2,317 tok/s) | 31.7 s (1,857 tok/s) |
| 128K | 70.4 s (1,862 tok/s) | 74.5 s (1,581 tok/s) |
| 192K | no entry | 127.9 s (1,381 tok/s) |
| 256K | no entry | 191.7 s (1,228 tok/s) |

The llama.cpp prefill lead narrows with depth. Server-measured, it prefills a 64K prompt in
28.7 s against 31.7 s (a 10% lead) and a 128K prompt in 71.6 s against 74.5 s (4%); the
server path costs llama.cpp 2-4% over the bare-loop estimates above. Everything past its
144K ceiling is NInfer-only. Decode inverts the shallow picture. NInfer leads by 10%
shallow and by 27% at 128K without speculation, and the MTP3 gap grows with depth:

| Workload | llama.cpp `draft-mtp` | NInfer MTP3 (E8) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Code, shallow | 118.8 tok/s at 85.9% acceptance | 142.9 tok/s at 78.0% |
| Prose, 64K depth | 55.5 tok/s at 45.3% | 86.1 tok/s at 42.3% |
| Prose, 128K depth | 42.3 tok/s at 45.4% | 77.5 tok/s at 41.6% |
| Prose, 256K depth | no entry | 65.4 tok/s at 41.1% |
| Code, 256K depth | no entry | 91.2 tok/s at 72.1% |

The NInfer rows in this table use the 2026-08-17 generated corpora; acceptance on them runs
a few points below the 2026-08-15 payloads (code 78% against 81%), which accounts for the
difference from the headline 148.6 tok/s. The llama.cpp MTP rows required a reduced
131,584-token context; the draft buffers push VRAM
to 23.8 of 24 GiB, and the deployed 144K llama.cpp configuration cannot fit them at all.
NInfer serves 172,032 tokens with MTP in the same VRAM at INT8 KV, and the full native
262,144 with the E8 4-bit KV default. Acceptance matches per content type, so the decode gap
is engine time, not draft quality.

## Quick start (Linux)

Requirements: an RTX 4090, a recent NVIDIA driver, Docker with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.

Build the image and download the model once:

```bash
docker build --tag ninfer-4090:sm89 .
NINFER_MODEL_DIR="$PWD/models" bash scripts/download-qwen38.sh
```

Then start one of the three profiles. The API is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`.

All three profiles run one generation slot. Extra requests wait in the admission
queue, and the queue deadline defaults to 30 seconds. A deep prefill can hold the
slot longer than that, so parallel agent clients would fail with
`request_queue_timeout`. The `--pending-timeout-ms 600000` line raises the
deadline to 10 minutes. On a streaming request the timeout arrives as an in-band
SSE error event after HTTP 200; a client that does not parse error events sees a
stream that ends without a `finish_reason`. See [docs/serving.md](docs/serving.md)
for the full queue contract.

### Text-only, full 262K native context (E8 4-bit KV, default)

The E8 Conway-Sloane lattice KV mode (`rk4v4-e8`, ported from
[UDPSendToFailed/ninfer-4090](https://github.com/UDPSendToFailed/ninfer-4090); see
[the fork comparison](docs/udp-fork-comparison.md)) fits the model's entire native
262,144-token context on 24 GB with 1.4 GiB to spare:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --publish 8080:8080 \
  --volume "$PWD/models:/workspace/models:ro" \
  ninfer-4090:sm89 \
  ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 \
  --max-context 262144 --kv-capacity 262144 \
  --max-concurrency 1 --max-pending-requests 16 \
  --pending-timeout-ms 600000 \
  --prefill-chunk 1024 --kv-dtype rk4v4-e8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

Measured against INT8 KV on this build: identical MTP acceptance at 111K depth
(78.8% vs 78.4%), a 5.7% decode tax (126.6 vs 134.2 tok/s on a shallow greedy code
probe), prefill within 1-2% at matched depth, and exact single-needle, 5-needle, and
code-detail retrieval through 260K tokens.

### Text-only, 168K context (INT8 KV, maximum precision)

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --publish 8080:8080 \
  --volume "$PWD/models:/workspace/models:ro" \
  ninfer-4090:sm89 \
  ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 \
  --max-context 172032 --kv-capacity 172032 \
  --max-concurrency 1 --max-pending-requests 16 \
  --pending-timeout-ms 600000 \
  --prefill-chunk 1024 --kv-dtype int8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft \
  --preserve-thinking
```

### With vision, 96K context

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all --publish 8080:8080 \
  --volume "$PWD/models:/workspace/models:ro" \
  ninfer-4090:sm89 \
  ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 \
  --max-context 98304 --kv-capacity 98304 \
  --max-concurrency 1 --max-pending-requests 16 \
  --pending-timeout-ms 600000 \
  --prefill-chunk 1024 --kv-dtype int8 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 --lm-head-draft \
  --vision --preserve-thinking
```

### The tradeoff

KV precision, vision, and maximum context trade against each other on a 24 GB card:

| Profile | KV mode | Context | KV runtime | Startup slack |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Text-only, MTP3 | `rk4v4-e8` | 262144 (256K) | 5.08 GiB | 1.37 GiB |
| Text-only, MTP3 | `rk2v4-e8` | 262144 (256K) | 4.01 GiB | 2.43 GiB |
| Text-only, MTP3 | `int8` | 172032 (168K) | 6.31 GiB | 136 MiB |
| With `--vision`, MTP3 | `rk2v4-e8` | 262144 (256K) | 5.85 GiB | 329 MiB |
| With `--vision`, MTP3 | `rk4v4-e8` | 212992 (208K) | 6.06 GiB | 108 MiB |
| With `--vision`, MTP3 | `int8` | 98304 (96K) | - | ~1 GiB |

262,144 is the model's own context limit, so `rk2v4-e8` (2-bit keys, 96.2% cosine)
buys no additional context over `rk4v4-e8` in the text-only profile - only slack.
That slack is what pays for vision: the E8 modes dissolve most of the old
vision-against-context tradeoff. Vision costs about 2.1 GiB (1.83 GiB of runtime
buffers plus a 0.28 GiB tower), which INT8 could only afford at 96K. With 2-bit
keys the full native 262,144 fits alongside vision; with 4-bit keys the measured
ceiling is 219008 (1.5 MiB slack), so 212992 is the practical line. Both vision
modes answer a two-swatch color oracle exactly at temperature 0, including with
the image buried under 52,700 tokens of text on `rk2v4-e8`. `rk2v4-e8` also passes
the text retrieval gates (single-needle at 260K, 5-needle at 118K, exact code
details at 168K) at a 10% decode tax (120.5 tok/s on the shallow code probe). The
INT8 text-only ceiling is near 176K: 172032 starts, and 196608 is rejected at
startup with a byte-exact deficit. The server validates memory before it listens,
so an oversized context fails fast instead of at request time.

For a native build, follow the [Linux build guide](docs/rtx-3090-linux.md) with
`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89` (the default in this fork). The build requires CUDA 12.8 or newer,
GCC 13, and CMake 3.28 or newer; the Docker image builds with CUDA 13.1.

## What this fork changes

This fork descends from [sergiuszm/ninfer-4090](https://github.com/sergiuszm/ninfer-4090)
and inherits its full `sm_89` port (retuned attention prefill, E8 4-bit KV at the
native 262,144 context, MTP3, vision, `/metrics` and `/slots` endpoints). On top of
that upstream base it adds two things needed to run alongside llama.cpp under
llama-swap — see [the fork comparison](docs/fork-vs-upstream.md) for the measured
delta:

- **llama.cpp-compatible `timings` in responses.** ninfer-serve now serializes the
  phase timing it already measures into a llama.cpp-shaped top-level `timings` block
  (Prompt/Decode rates, MTP draft acceptance, cache hits, TTFT) on chat-completion
  responses and streaming chunks, so llama-swap-style proxies surface per-request
  performance for ninfer-served models.
- **Unified llama-swap image (`Dockerfile.llamaswap`).** A second Dockerfile builds
  the engine against CUDA 12.9 and copies `ninfer`/`ninfer-serve` into the
  `ghcr.io/mostlygeek/llama-swap:unified-cuda` runtime stage, so one container serves
  llama-swap, llama.cpp, ik-llama-server, and ninfer together. The upstream
  standalone CUDA 13.1 `Dockerfile` is unchanged.

- **`sm_89` retarget.** The CMake architecture pin, the runtime compute-capability check, and the
  NVFP4 stub gate now select `sm_89`. Most SM86 kernel schedules run unmodified on Ada; the
  INT8 attention prefill schedule is retuned (below).
- **Ada-retuned INT8 attention prefill.** The SM120 schedule spills registers on Ada and pays the
  consumer half-rate penalty for f32-accumulate HMMA. Arch-gated for `sm_89`: the full
  128-register budget, eight paired producer warps over `Bc` column halves with one named-barrier
  exchange per key tile, byte-permute V dequantization (bit-identical), and fp16-accumulated PV
  tiles folded into the fp32 running accumulator each tile. The kernel gains 30% at 64K depth
  (109 to 143 TFLOP/s on the `d256-h24-kv4` INT8 append shape); serve prefill gains 5-7% at
  88K-128K. Needle-in-a-haystack retrieval stays exact at both depths and all 84 suite tests
  pass, which bounds the fp16-accumulation numerics change.
- **`/v1/models` reports `context_window`.** Clients without access to a llama.cpp `/props` or a
  vLLM `max_model_len` can size prompts from the models payload.
- **`GET /metrics`.** Prometheus counters under llama.cpp-compatible names
  (`llamacpp:prompt_tokens_total`, `llamacpp:prompt_seconds_total`,
  `llamacpp:tokens_predicted_total`, `llamacpp:tokens_predicted_seconds_total`,
  `llamacpp:requests_processing`, `llamacpp:requests_deferred`), so existing scrapers read this
  server without changes. Prompt tokens count only computed prefill; prefix-cache hits are
  excluded, as in llama.cpp. Additional `ninfer:` series report request totals, prefix-cache
  hits, and MTP draft/acceptance totals.
- **`GET /slots`.** A llama.cpp-shaped slot table built from in-flight requests, for dashboards
  that poll slot state. Entries are HTTP-layer FIFO positions; per-slot cache detail is unknown
  mid-flight and reported as zero.
- **NVFP4-A4 test gating.** The A4 activation tests skip on hardware without FP4 tensor cores
  instead of aborting. The full remaining suite passes on the RTX 4090.
- **E8 lattice KV quantization (ported).** The `rk8v4`/`rk4v4`/`rk4v4-e8`/`rk2v4-e8` KV modes
  and the 262K-to-1M visible-keys envelope lift from the
  [UDPSendToFailed/ninfer-4090](https://github.com/UDPSendToFailed/ninfer-4090) sibling fork,
  merged under this fork's retuned `sm_89` attention prefill schedule. The E8 codec verifies
  bit-exactly against the upstream microbenchmark (96.155% / 98.678% cosine); their 1 GiB
  CUDA-graph allowance bump was deliberately not taken (it would evict the INT8 168K profile).
  Method and measurements in [docs/udp-fork-comparison.md](docs/udp-fork-comparison.md).

## Known limits on the RTX 4090

- Prefill trails llama.cpp by 16-24% on full 32K-128K prompts under matched conditions (see
  the depth sweep above). The rate is flat across `--prefill-chunk` 1024 to 2688, so the
  chunk size is not the lever. With the attention schedule retuned, the remaining gap sits in
  the custom quantized GEMMs, which run about 10% below cuBLAS on Ada. Decode is where this
  engine leads.
- Keep `--prefill-chunk` at 2688 or below. This fork carries measured `sm_89` cooperative
  residency tables (the former hard abort above chunk 1024 is fixed), and chunks through 2688
  stay on split-K. Larger chunks route to the unsplit schedule, which is marginally less
  accurate at its onset (about 1e-5 relative).
- Concurrency above one request is untested in this fork. The published cohort results in the
  [3090 base](https://github.com/Don-Chad/ninfer-3090) do not transfer directly.
- The limits of the base engine apply: one process, one GPU, one model, bounded FIFO admission,
  no multi-GPU execution, no weight offload.

## Artifact

| Model | Artifact | Size |
|---|---|---:|
| Qwen3.8-27B | [official NInfer groupwise artifact](https://huggingface.co/neroued/Qwen3.8-27B-NInfer) | 16.96 GiB |

The artifact is architecture-independent; the model card's RTX 5090 requirement describes the
upstream engine, not the file. Verify the download against the SHA-256 published on the card.

## Reasoning effort

Qwen3.8-27B has three trained reasoning depths plus an off switch. OpenAI Chat Completions
accepts a top-level `reasoning_effort` field (`low`, `medium`, `xhigh`) and a top-level
`enable_thinking` boolean; hidden reasoning returns separately as `message.reasoning_content`.
The `chat_template_kwargs` request field of llama.cpp is not supported and is rejected. For the
CLI, pass `--reasoning-effort` or `--no-thinking`. Sampling defaults come from the model card and
switch with the thinking mode.

## Serving APIs

OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses with streaming and local continuation state, Anthropic
Messages, prompt-rendered function tools with parsed tool calls, compatible-prefix reuse, and
JSONL request logs. See [HTTP serving](docs/serving.md) and [CLI usage](docs/cli.md).
